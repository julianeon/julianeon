### Hello World 👋

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California.

I like to code, run and read science fiction. I'm reading Code, by Petzold, now. 

I read Hacker News and Indie Hackers. Also lobste.rs.

I like reading about coding, entrepreneurship and AI.

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi!
