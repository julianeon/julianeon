## About Me

I'm Julian Martinez, @julianeon on most platforms.

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California.

I've worked at PagerDuty, Ripple and GraphQL, often helping users with open source products.

In the past few years, I've used React a lot with AWS, especially AWS Amplify and its associated services: s3, Cognito, DynamoDB, and AppSync. These days, I use [Svelte](https://javascriptpage.com/react-svelte-pitch-deck-app-comparison)  more. 

Languages I can code with: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Lisp, Rust.

I use Linux (Ubuntu), the i3 window manager, and [switch between vim and Emacs](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/vim-vs-emacs-how-to-think-about-them-and-choose-your-editor-403456467456).


I'm on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com), if you read those. I like coding, running and reading [nonfiction](https://www.amazon.com/Trillions-Renegades-Invented-Changed-Finance/dp/B08TLZHNPS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22MFA68EHGBQV&keywords=trillions&qid=1696789538&s=books&sprefix=trillions%2Cstripbooks%2C168&sr=1-1) and [science fiction](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/books/best-philip-k-dick-novels.htm](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/books/best-philip-k-dick-novels.html). 

You can read my [repo guide](repo_guide.md) to learn more about my GitHub code.

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi, on Telegram or Discord, at @julianeon.
