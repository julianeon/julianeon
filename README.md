## About Me

I'm Julian Martinez, @julianeon on most platforms.

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California. üè¥Û†ÅµÛ†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å°Û†Åø

I've used React a lot with AWS, especially AWS Amplify and its associated services: s3, Cognito, DynamoDB, and AppSync. These days, I use Svelte more. 

Languages I know: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Lisp, Rust.

I also use Linux (Ubuntu), the i3 window manager, and [switch between vim and Emacs](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/vim-vs-emacs-how-to-think-about-them-and-choose-your-editor-403456467456).

I like to code, run and read science fiction. I'm reading Code, by Petzold, now. 

I'm on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com), if you read those. 

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi, on Telegram or Discord, at @julianeon.
