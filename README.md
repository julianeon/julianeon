### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

![eye globe image](eye_globe.png)

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California.

I like to code, run on the beach and read science fiction. I'm reading Code, by Petzold, now. 

I frequent Hacker News and Indie Hackers. Also lobste.rs.

Send me your links about coding, entrepreneurship and AI. 

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi!
