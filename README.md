### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software consultant and product support specialist living in San Francisco, California.

I like to code, run and read (I'm reading Code, by Petzold, now). 

I read Hacker News and Indie Hackers. 

I like to learn about coding, entrepreneurship and AI.

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi!
