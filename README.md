## About Me

I'm Julian Martinez, @julianeon on most platforms.

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California.

I've used React a lot with AWS, especially AWS Amplify and its associated services: s3, Cognito, DynamoDB, and AppSync. These days, I use Svelte more. 

Languages I can code with: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Lisp, Rust.

I use Linux (Ubuntu), the i3 window manager, and [switch between vim and Emacs](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/vim-vs-emacs-how-to-think-about-them-and-choose-your-editor-403456467456).

I like coding, running and reading science fiction. Big fan of the [command line](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#2-a-brief-history-lesson) and [bash scripting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33354286).

I'm on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com), if you read those. 

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi, on Telegram or Discord, at @julianeon.
