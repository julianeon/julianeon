## About Me

I'm Julian Martinez, @julianeon on most platforms.

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California.

I worked at PagerDuty, Ripple and GraphQL, often by helping users with open source products.

In the past few years, I've used React a lot with AWS, especially AWS Amplify and its associated services: s3, Cognito, DynamoDB, and AppSync. These days, I use [Svelte](https://javascriptpage.com/react-svelte-pitch-deck-app-comparison)  more. 

Languages I can code with: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Lisp, Rust.

I use Linux (Ubuntu), the i3 window manager, and [switch between vim and Emacs](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/vim-vs-emacs-how-to-think-about-them-and-choose-your-editor-403456467456).


I'm on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com). I like coding, running and reading [nonfiction](https://www.amazon.com/Trillions/dp/0241987970/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1696789538&sr=1-1) & [science fiction](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/books/best-philip-k-dick-novels.html). 

You can read my [repo guide](repo_guide.md) to learn more about my GitHub code.

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi, on Telegram or Discord, at @julianeon.
