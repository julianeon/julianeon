## About Me

I'm Julian Martinez, @julianeon on most platforms.

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California. You can read my thoughts on [product support](product_support.md).

I worked at PagerDuty, Ripple and Apollo GraphQL, helping users with open source products. After that I worked at my consultancy, Excelsitor.

You can read my [repo guide](repo_guide.md) to learn more about my GitHub code.

As a consultant, I used React a lot with AWS, especially AWS Amplify and its associated services: s3, Cognito, DynamoDB, AppSync, and Lambda. These days I use Svelte more, as I [explain](https://javascriptpage.com/react-svelte-pitch-deck-app-comparison) in this article on my JS tutorial site, [JavaScriptPage](https://javascriptpage.com).

Languages I've used: [JavaScript](repo_guide.md), [Python](https://github.com/julianeon/slackbot), [Ruby](https://github.com/julianeon/useful-ruby-scripts), Go, Lisp, Perl, [Rust](https://github.com/julianeon/moodtracker/tree/main), [Bash](https://github.com/julianeon/useful-bash-scripts). 

At the moment almost all my repos are in JS, but I'll more code examples of the other languages over time.

I'm proficient with the command line and Linux (Linux Essentials certification). User of [vim & Emacs](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/vim-vs-emacs-how-to-think-about-them-and-choose-your-editor-403456467456).

## Interests 

I'm on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com). 

I like coding, running [(former member)](https://goldengaterunningclub.org/) and [books](books.md).

I also like to hunt for good repos on here, like this one on [complex systems](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101).

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi, on Telegram or Discord, at @julianeon.
