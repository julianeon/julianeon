## About Me

I'm Julian Martinez, @julianeon on most platforms.

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California.

I've used React a lot with AWS, especially AWS Amplify and its associated services: s3, Cognito, DynamoDB, and AppSync. These days, I use [Svelte](https://javascriptpage.com/react-svelte-pitch-deck-app-comparison)  more. 

Languages I can code with: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Lisp, Rust.

I use Linux (Ubuntu), the i3 window manager, and [switch between vim and Emacs](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/vim-vs-emacs-how-to-think-about-them-and-choose-your-editor-403456467456).

I like coding, running and reading science fiction. I'm on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com), if you read those. 

You can read my [repo guide](repo_guide.md) to learn more about my public code here.

Also, I'm [on](https://twitter.com/julianeon)-[line](https://fosstodon.org/@julianeon). Say hi, on Telegram or Discord, at @julianeon.
