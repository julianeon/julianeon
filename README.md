### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software consultant and product support aficionado living in San Francisco, California.

I use Linux (Ubuntu) and the i3 window manager. I've used React a lot and AWS, especially AWS Amplify and its associated services: s3, Cogito, and AppSync.

I like to code, run and read science fiction. I'm reading Code, by Petzold, now. 

I'm on Hacker News and Indie Hackers, if you read those. 

Also, I'm friendly. Say hi!
