## About Me

![worplaces: pagerduty, ripple, apollographql](workplaces.png)

I'm Julian Martinez, @julianeon on most platforms.

I'm a technical support engineer and software consultant (project management, web dev). I live in SF, CA and work remotely. 

I do technical support at [Block](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianeon/), where I oversee a busy Slack chat room. I also did technical support at Apollo GraphQL, Ripple and PagerDuty, mostly [product support](product_support.md). At my consultancy, Excelsitor, I focused on cryptocurrency projects.

You can read my [repo guide](repo_guide.md) to learn more about my GitHub code and see [examples](https://javascriptpage.com/react-svelte-pitch-deck-app-comparison) of my writing on my [JavaScriptPage](https://javascriptpage.com) site. 

Languages I've used: [JavaScript](repo_guide.md), [TypeScript](https://github.com/julianeon/userform), [Ruby](https://github.com/julianeon/useful-ruby-scripts), [Python](https://github.com/julianeon/slackbot), [Rust](https://github.com/julianeon/moodtracker/tree/main), [Bash](https://github.com/julianeon/useful-bash-scripts), [Lisp](https://gist.github.com/julianeon/11f71c1a860c292b1699a9f75a6c3e0e), Go, Perl. I use Ruby snippets at work.

I'm proficient with the command line and [Linux Essentials](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-010-objectives) certified. I use a Macbook at work and Ubuntu on a Thinkpad at home.


## Interests 

I like coding, bodyboarding, [running](https://goldengaterunningclub.org/) and [books](books.md).

I also like to hunt for good repos here, like this one on [complex systems](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101).

Speaking of repos, I keep my personal todo list on GitHub (private), which is why I'm active on here every day. I use it daily, with the exception of vacations.

Say hi, on Telegram or Discord, at @julianeon.
