## Product Support

Product support is what I've spent most of my career doing. I'm passionate about doing it well.

In my view, helping customers isn't just about solving problems. It's about being a guide who helps them get the most out of our product. It goes beyond technology, to making sure people feel happy and confident with our offering.

My guiding principles are simple: be kind and solve problems thoroughly. 

Being kind means really listening to what customers are saying. It acknowledges that when things go wrong, it can be frustrating. It means reassuring the customer that we're here to help without losing our friendly tone (or temper). Whatever happens, it's important to be on their side. 

Solving problems means giving the customer what they asked for: a real, viable, solution. A good solution isn't just technically correct; it's also explained in a way that makes sense to the person using our product, without condescension or, at the other extreme, unnecessary detail.

Being proactive is also important. This might mean creating guides or FAQs that customers can use to solve common issues on their own, following best practices (["building a knowledge base"](https://zapier.com/blog/build-knowledge-base-documentation/) from Zapier). It might also mean writing scripts to demonstrate how to do something ([gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/julianeon?direction=desc&sort=created)).

In short, my job in support goes beyond fixing things. It's about being a friendly, understanding helper who transforms the customer experience into a smooth and pleasant one.

## Support Guidelines

At one level, support is about doing the work of answering customer questions. At another level, it's about helping the company to serve the customer better.

To do both, there should be a system in place to register all requests, and make sure they're all responded to in a timely fashion. For me, that system was usually Zendesk.

Even when the ticket volume is high, I agree with [Zendesk](https://cxtrends.zendesk.com/trends/trend-3) that businesses should personalize support. 

It's important to make every customer feel appreciated by asking the right questions, updating enough for the conversation to feel alive, and making the resolution something they can feel positive about by the end. 

_Most companies hold a rather narrow view of what personalization means, which is at odds with the 62 percent of consumers who think these businesses could be doing more [according to Zendesk's research]. These customers don’t want to be lumped into some demographic bucket—they crave experiences in which they’re a segment of one, not thousands._

_Think of it like the barista who greets you by your name, starts whipping up your normal order, and then asks a follow up question about something you talked about during your last visit._

Language is important too: be polite, but don't overdo the stuffy language, because that can sound like a copy-pasted template. 

This [infographic](https://fieldedge.com/blog/guide-to-great-customer-service-infographic/) lays down good rules for communication that I follow myself.

When I'm asked a technical question, I try to be specific and give steps to follow in my response, as shown by this answer from kronis.dev in [Situation #2](https://quick-answers.kronis.dev/).

Finally, to see great customer service in action, see Steve Jobs turning a tough question into a teachable moment on the [customer experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2O5qKZlI50).

## Support As A Department

These rules form a good foundation for Support as a unit within the company (adapted from [Apptivo](https://www.apptivo.com/blog/customer-support-importance-types-and-best-practices/)).

- Be accessible and available in every supported channel. Consider which channels should be supported.

- Track which questions are frequently asked and dedicate a website section, or a knowledge base, to those answers.

- Have periodic meetings to brainstorm about different responses, missed bugs, missing features or the difficulties in resolving issues.

- Share the ideas from these meetings with other teams.

- Makre sure the team has the knowledge and expertise to explain the technical know-how of the product and service.

- Measure the performance of key customer support metrics.

- Consider visual communication (video, screenshots with arrows, etc.) when things are difficult to explain over plain text.


On the topic of communication, I endorse these rules (adapted from [GitHub](https://github.blog/2023-10-04-how-to-communicate-like-a-github-engineer-our-principles-practices-and-tools/)).

- Write things down.
- Make work visible and overcommunicate.
- Embrace collaboration.
- Foster a culture that values documentation maintenance.
- Communicate openly, honestly, and authentically.
- Be asynchronous when it helps.

## The Next Level 

To provide next level customer service, I believe the whole company has to be involved. 

Support receives the messages from users and answers them, but other parts of the company have to prioritize feature requests and the user experience overall, to change the product itself. 


Whenever I notice patterns or repeated issues, I make sure to let the Product team know, and any other team member who is interested. If customers are saying it, I'll communicate it.

It's also good for Support to talk to the Sales team, to know what the most important customers may not write down but are saying in meetings and calls. When Support and Sales are on the same page, it helps everyone.

With the right leadership, the company can make changes that transform the user experience, in ways that make the best things better and prevent the worst issues from repeating. "Customer obsession is not just listening to customers... Customer obsession is also inventing on their behalf," as [Jeff Bezos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHvD0DVcKAw) once said.

At the end of the day, we're all on the same team. Our job is to deliver an exceptional experience to customers. 

By listening to our user's needs, acting on what we've learned, and continuing to improve every quarter, we can help the company reach its goals - by helping the people who pay us to help them.
