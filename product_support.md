## About

Product support is what I've spent most of my career in tech doing. I care deeply about it.

At one level, it's about doing the work of answering the customers and making sure everything is resolved to their satisfaction. 

So at a minimum, there should be a system in place to register all requests, and make sure they're all responded to in a timely fashion. For me, that system was usually Zendesk.

The danger of a system like that, especially if it's processing a large number of requests, is that everyone can become a number. 

I agree with Zendesk's [findings](https://cxtrends.zendesk.com/trends/trend-3), that business need to work to personalize support. 

To quote:

_Here’s what Zendesk’s research illuminated: most companies hold a rather narrow view of what personalization means, which is at odds with the 62 percent of consumers who think these businesses could be doing more. These customers don’t want to be lumped into some demographic bucket—they crave experiences in which they’re a segment of one, not thousands._

_Think of it like the barista who greets you by your name, starts whipping up your normal order, and then asks a follow up question about something you talked about during your last visit. Consumers want that experience writ large, whether it’s in a brick-and-mortar store or on an e-commerce site._

I think it's important to make every customer feel listened to and heard, by asking the right questions, responding quickly enough for the conversation to feel alive, and making sure the resolution is something the customer can accept (minimum) and feel great about (preferable).

This [infographic](https://fieldedge.com/blog/guide-to-great-customer-service-infographic/) lays down good rules for customer service that I follow in my work.

To provide truly next level customer service, I believe the whole company has to be involved. 

Support receives the requests from the users and answer them, but Product also needs to be involved to prioritize the feature requests and user experience overall.

This is a good introduction to my approach to product support, but I'm happy to go into more detail upon request.
