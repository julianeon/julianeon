## Product Support

Product support is what I've spent most of my career doing. I'm passionate about doing it well.

In my view, helping customers isn't just about solving problems. It's about being a guide who helps them get the most out of our product. It goes beyond technology, to making sure people feel happy and confident while they're using our service.

My guiding principles are simple: be kind and solve problems thoroughly. 

Being kind means really listening to what customers are saying. It acknowledges that when things go wrong it can be frustrating. It means reassuring the customer that we're here to help without ever losing control of our tone (or temper). Whatever happens, it's important to show that we're on their side. 

Solving problems means giving the customer what they asked for: a real, viable, solution. A good solution isn't just technically correct; it's also explained in a way that makes sense to the person using our product, without condescension or, at the other end, unnecessary detail.

Being proactive is also important. This might mean creating guides or FAQs that customers can use to solve common issues on their own, following best practices (["building a knowledge base"](https://zapier.com/blog/build-knowledge-base-documentation/) from Zapier). It might also mean writing scripts to demonstrate how to do something ([gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/julianeon?direction=desc&sort=created)).

In short, my job in support goes beyond fixing things. It's about being a friendly, understanding helper who transforms the customer experience into a smooth and pleasant one.

## Support Protocols

At one level, support is about doing the work of answering customer questions so that everything is tied up by the end of the conversation.

At a minimum, there should be a system in place to register all requests, and make sure they're all responded to in a timely fashion. For me, that system was usually Zendesk.

The danger of a system like that, especially if it's handling a lot of requests, is that the customer can become a number, a statistic in the aggregate.

I agree with [Zendesk](https://cxtrends.zendesk.com/trends/trend-3) that businesses should personalize support. 

_Here’s what Zendesk’s research illuminated: most companies hold a rather narrow view of what personalization means, which is at odds with the 62 percent of consumers who think these businesses could be doing more. These customers don’t want to be lumped into some demographic bucket—they crave experiences in which they’re a segment of one, not thousands._

_Think of it like the barista who greets you by your name, starts whipping up your normal order, and then asks a follow up question about something you talked about during your last visit._

It's important to make every customer feel appreciated by asking the right questions, updating enough for the conversation to feel alive, and making sure the resolution is something they can feel positive about by the end. 

Language is important too: be polite, but don't overdo the stuffy language, because that can sound too much like a template. 

This [infographic](https://fieldedge.com/blog/guide-to-great-customer-service-infographic/) lays down good rules for customer service that I also strive to follow.

I also try to be specific and give steps to follow in my response, as modeled by the technical solution shown in [Situation #2](https://quick-answers.kronis.dev/).

## The Next Level 

To provide next level customer service, I believe the whole company has to be involved. 

Support receives the messages from users and answers them, but other parts of the company have to prioritize the feature requests and user experience overall. It's also good for Support to talk to the sales team, to know what the most important customers may not write down but are saying in meetings and calls. 

Whenever I notice patterns or repeated issues, I make sure to let the Product team know, and any other team member who is interested. If customers are saying it, I'll communicate it.


With the right leadership, the company can make updates or changes that transform the user experience, in ways that make the best things better and prevent the worst issues from repeating. "Customer obsession is not just listening to customers... Customer obsession is also inventing on their behalf," as [Jeff Bezos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHvD0DVcKAw) once said.

At the end of the day, we're all on the same team. Our job is to deliver an exceptional experience to customers. By listening to their needs, acting on what we've learned, and continuing to improve every quarter, we can help the company reach its goals - by helping the people who pay us to help them.
