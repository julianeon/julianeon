# Repo Guide

This is a guide to my repositories on Glitch, linked to from my [repo page](./repo_guide.md). 

I have 16 JavaScript apps on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) at [glitch.com/@julianeon](https://glitch.com/@julianeon). 

Each of them, when you click it, will take 1-3 minutes to load. But by reading this guide, you can get a sense of what you'll see before you decide to click and wait for it to load.

The demo is at the top and the link is at the bottom.
