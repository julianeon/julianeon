# Glitch Guide

This is a guide to my repositories on Glitch, linked to from my [repo page](./repo_guide.md). 

I have 16 JavaScript apps on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) at [glitch.com/@julianeon](https://glitch.com/@julianeon).  I created each of them from scratch; none are copies, or forks, of other code.

Each app, when you click on it, will take 1-3 minutes to load. 

By reading this guide, you can get a sense of what you'll see after it loads, and decide if it's worth the wait.

On each app's page, the demo will be shown in a window at the top while the code will be accessible through a link ("View Source") towards the bottom.

Feel free to fork any of these and reuse the code under the MIT license.

The apps are shown below in the same order they appear in on my Glitch profile page, with descriptions and screenshots taken after loading.

## bouncing balls 

![glitch ball game screenshot](./glitch_bouncing_balls.png)

In this app, you select the color of the ball and enter a number for the size in pixels of the ball (suggested value: 100). 

A ball will then bounce onto the screen, of that size and color.

## circles

![glitch circle screenshot](./glitch_circles.png)

In this app, a circle within a circle appears on the screen. After a few seconds, a differently colored circle pair replaces it.

The app then alternates between showing these two circle pairs.

## memory game

![glitch memory game screenshot](./glitch_memory.png)

In this app, you can click on squares to uncover names briefly, as in the card game of memory. 

When you click the same name on different squares consecutively, the word pair stays uncovered. 

When you uncover all the names, you win.
