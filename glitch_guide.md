# Repo Guide

This is a guide to my repositories on Glitch, linked to from my [repo page](./repo_guide.md). 

I have 16 JavaScript apps on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) at [glitch.com/@julianeon](https://glitch.com/@julianeon). 

Each app, when you click on it, will take 1-3 minutes to load. 

By reading this guide, you can get a sense of what you'll see after it loads, to decide if it's worth the wait.

On each app's page, the demo will be shown in a window at the top while the code will be accessible through a link ("View Source") towards the bottom.

The apps & links, with screenshots taken after loading, are shown below.
