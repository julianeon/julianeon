## Repo Guide

This is a guide to my repositories on GitHub, linked to from my [profile](./README.md). 

Most of my repos are in JavaScript. 

To see a recent example of a customized React template being used for a landing page, see [React-Landing-Page-Learn React](https://github.com/julianeon/React-Landing-Page-Learn-React), which I adapted from a template.

This is the live (demo) version of that repo:

http://react-landing-page-learn-react.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Many of my repos are one-shot apps used to display something or do something fun, created over 1-3 days.

_Example: click on a box to make it disappear at [count.mindwiller.com](https://count.mindwiller.com)._

Repos with 'react' in the name were made with React, using hooks. 

I host almost all my apps, once complete, on AWS.

Example, Svelte:

[hometoolzone.com](https://www.hometoolzone.com/)

You can see demos for some of my JavaScript apps at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@julianeon).
