# About

This is a guide to my repositories on GitHub, linked to from my [profile](./README.md). 

Most of them are in JavaScript. 

Many of those are one-shot apps used to display something or do something fun, created over 1-3 days.

_Example: click on a box to make it disappear at [count.mindwiller.com](https://count.mindwiller.com)._

Repos with 'react' in the name were made with React, using hooks. 

I host almost all my apps, once complete, on AWS.

Example, Svelte:

You can see demos for some of these apps at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@julianeon).
