## Repo Guide

This is a guide to my repositories on GitHub, linked to from my [profile](./README.md). 

Most of my repos are web apps made with JavaScript. Most of the recent ones are made with React, though I can just as easily work with Next.js or Svelte. 

To see a recent example of a React template I customized for a landing page, see [React-Landing-Page-Learn React](https://github.com/julianeon/React-Landing-Page-Learn-React).

This is the live (demo) version of that repo, which I'm hosting on AWS:

http://react-landing-page-learn-react.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Many of my repos are one-shot apps used to display something or do something fun, created over 1-3 days.

_Example: click on a box to make it disappear at [count.mindwiller.com](https://count.mindwiller.com)._

Repos with 'react' in the name were made with React, using hooks. 

I host almost all my apps, once complete, on AWS.

Example, Svelte:

[hometoolzone.com](https://www.hometoolzone.com/)

I have completed more advanced apps with authentication and access to various AWS services such as AppSync, but those aren't here since they can't be hosted locally as easily as an app without AWS credentials. 

I can share that code upon request.

You can see demos for some of my JavaScript apps at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@julianeon).
