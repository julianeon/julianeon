# About

This is a guide to my repositories on GitHub. 

Most of them are in JavaScript. 

Many of those are one-shot apps used to display something or do something fun, created over 1-3 days.

Apps with 'react' in the name were made with React. Almost all of them use hooks, not classes.

I host most of my apps, once complete, on AWS.

Example of a Svelte app I created:

[hometoolzone.com](https://www.hometoolzone.com/)

You can see demos for some of these apps at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@julianeon).
