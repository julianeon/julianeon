## Books

Here is a list of books I've read and enjoyed.

I recommend all these books.

### Fiction

I'm a big fan of Phillip K. Dick and his best books - Man In The High Castle and Ubik, especially.

A close second would be The Best of Greg Egan.

Two books that I loved that I rarely see mentioned are Bodard's Obsidian & Blood series & Garfinkel's All Of An Instant.

On the longer side: In Search of Lost Time, War and Peace, Moby Dick.

Also read Vol. 1 of The Arabian Nights (1 of 3). Working on the next volume.

Greatly enjoyed LOTR and Dune.

### Nonfiction

For a history of tech, Fire In The Valley is outstanding.

Tim Wu's The Attention Merchants is terrific too, more of a global history of technology.

The Maverick & His Machine by Maney makes a good companion piece, starting with IBM's origins as a conglomerate making things like calculating machines.

I learned a lot from Global Capitalism by Freidan.

The Chosen by Karabel is incredible, a history of American university admissions.

The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Rhodes is great too.

The Penguin History of the World was also great, for what it is.

If you like psychology, Barrett's How Emotions Are Made is a classic in the making.
