Here is a list of books I've read and enjoyed.

I recommend all the books here.

### Nonfiction

Startup histories: Soni's The Founders (PayPal), Stone's The Everything Store (Amazon), Isaacson's Steve Jobs & Merchant's The One Device: The iPhone (Apple), Levy's In The Plex (Google) and Facebook: The Inside Story (Facebook), Frier's No Filter (Instagram), Lagorio-Chafkin's We Are The Nerds (Reddit), Bilton's Hatching Twitter (X), Benioff's Behind The Cloud (Salesforce).

For a history of venture capital, consider Nicholas' VC: A History, Stross' The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, and Chafkin's The Contrarian: Peter Thiel.

For a history of the PC, Fire In The Valley, by Swaine & Freiberger, is outstanding. Riordan & Hoddeson's Crystal Fire explains the early part of that, the history of the transistor and the start of the information age. Petzold's Code covers hardware and software. For Unix, I recommend Kernighan's Unix: A History.

On an even bigger scale, I learned a lot from Global Capitalism by Freidan. It pairs well with The Penguin History of the World by Roberts & Westad.

Among business biographies, my favorite is Ray Kroc's Grinding It Out. Meyer's Setting The Table has a lot to teach about Support. Maney's The Maverick & His Machine is a good history of early pre-computer IBM.

Wu's The Attention Merchants is a terrific history of mass media and its associated technologies. It goes well with Lorenz's Extremely Online, a must-read.

If you like psychology, Barrett's How Emotions Are Made is a future classic.

Easter's The Comfort Crisis changed my approach to health: I get daily outdoor time now.

### Fiction

I'm a fan of Philip K. Dick, especially The Man In The High Castle and Ubik.

A close second favorite would be Greg Egan. Try The Best of Greg Egan (short stories) or his novel Schild's Ladder.

Two books that I love that I rarely see mentioned are Bodard's Obsidian & Blood series and Garfinkel's All Of An Instant.

I like the classics: LOTR, Dune, Neuromancer, Snow Crash, A Wrinkle in Time.

For contemporary fiction, I nominate Smith's White Teeth.

On the longer side: In Search of Lost Time, War and Peace, Moby Dick, Dante's Inferno, Vol. 1 of The Arabian Nights (1 of 3).
