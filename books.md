Here is a list of books I've read and enjoyed.

### Nonfiction

Startup histories: Soni's The Founders (PayPal), Stone's The Everything Store (Amazon), Isaacson's Steve Jobs & Merchant's The One Device: The iPhone (Apple), Levy's In The Plex (Google) and Facebook: The Inside Story (Facebook), Frier's No Filter (Instagram), Lagorio-Chafkin's We Are The Nerds (Reddit), Bilton's Hatching Twitter (X), Benioff's Behind The Cloud (Salesforce).

For a history of venture capital, try Nicholas' VC: A History, Stross' The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, and Chafkin's The Contrarian: Peter Thiel.

For the PC, Fire In The Valley, by Swaine & Freiberger, is outstanding. Riordan & Hoddeson's Crystal Fire explains the transistor and the start of the information age. Petzold's Code covers hardware and software. For Unix, I recommend Kernighan's Unix: A History.

On an even bigger scale, I learned a lot from Global Capitalism by Freidan, which pairs well with The Penguin History of the World.

Among business biographies, my favorite is Ray Kroc's Grinding It Out. Meyer's Setting The Table has a lot to teach about support. Maney's The Maverick & His Machine is a good account of pre-computer IBM.

Wu's The Attention Merchants is a terrific history of mass media and its associated technologies. For the YouTube age, see Lorenz's Extremely Online.

For psychology, Barrett's How Emotions Are Made is a future classic. I liked Easter's The Comfort Crisis too.

### Fiction

I'm a big fan of Philip K. Dick, especially The Man In The High Castle and Ubik.

A close second favorite would be Greg Egan. Try The Best of Greg Egan or his novel Schild's Ladder.

Two books that I love that I rarely see mentioned are Bodard's Obsidian & Blood series and Garfinkel's All Of An Instant.

For contemporary fiction, I like Otessa Mosefeghi, Tai Lin and Hari Kunzru.

I respect the classics: LOTR, Dune, Neuromancer, Snow Crash, A Wrinkle in Time.

On the longer side: In Search of Lost Time, War and Peace, Moby Dick, Dante's Inferno, Vol. 1 of The Arabian Nights.
