I'm a big fan of Philip K. Dick and his books - Man In The High Castle and Ubik, especially.

A close second would be The Best of Greg Egan. Also liked Schild's Ladder.

I like Neal Stephenson too: Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon.

Two books that I loved that I rarely see mentioned are Bodard's Obsidian & Blood series & Garfinkel's All Of An Instant.

Greatly enjoyed LOTR and Dune. As a kid, I liked A Wrinkle of Time.

For period fiction, Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.

For contemporary fiction, Smith's White Teeth.

On the longer side: In Search of Lost Time, War and Peace, Moby Dick, Vol. 1 of The Arabian Nights (1 of 3). 

### Nonfiction

Startup histories: Stone's The Everything Store (Amazon), Levy's Facebook: The Inside Story, Frier's No Filter (Instagram), Bilton's Hatching Twitter.

For a history of tech, Fire In The Valley is outstanding.

Tim Wu's The Attention Merchants is terrific too, a global history of technology.

The Maverick & His Machine by Maney, about IBM and its founder Watson, makes a good companion piece.

I learned a lot from Global Capitalism by Freidan. It pairs well with The Penguin History of the World.

The Chosen by Karabel is incredible, a history of American university admissions.

The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Rhodes is great too.

Among business biographies, my favorite is Ray Kroc's Grinding It Out.

If you like psychology, Barrett's How Emotions Are Made is a future classic.
