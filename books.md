I recommend all these books.

### Fiction

I'm a big fan of Philip K. Dick and his books - The Man In The High Castle and Ubik, especially.

A close second would be The Best of Greg Egan (short stories). I also liked his novel Schild's Ladder.

Two books that I love that I rarely see mentioned are Bodard's Obsidian & Blood series & Garfinkel's All Of An Instant.

Greatly enjoyed LOTR, Dune, Neuromancer and Snow Crash. As a kid, I liked L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time.

For period fiction, Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.

For contemporary fiction, Smith's White Teeth.

On the longer side: In Search of Lost Time, War and Peace, Moby Dick, Vol. 1 of The Arabian Nights (1 of 3). 

### Nonfiction

Startup histories: Stone's The Everything Store (Amazon), Isaacson's Steve Jobs (Apple), Levy's Facebook: The Inside Story (Facebook), Levy's In The Plex (Google), Frier's No Filter (Instagram), Bilton's Hatching Twitter (X), Southwick's Everyone Else Must Fail (Oracle), Benioff's Behind The Cloud (Salesforce), Lagorio-Chafkin's We Are The Nerds (Reddit).

For a history of venture capital, consider Nicholas' VC: A History, Stross' The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combintor, and Chafkin's The Contrarian: Peter Thiel.

For a history of the PC, Fire In The Valley, by Swaine & Freiberger, is outstanding. Riordan and Hoddeson's Crystal Fire explains the early part of that, the history of the transistor and the start of the information age.


Tim Wu's The Attention Merchants is terrific too, as a broad history of technology.

On an even bigger scale, I learned a lot from Global Capitalism by Freidan. It goes well with The Penguin History of the World by Roberts & Westad.

Among business biographies, my favorite is Ray Kroc's Grinding It Out. The Maverick & His Machine by Maney, about IBM and its founder Watson, is a good tech centered one. Meyer's Setting The Table, about hospitality, is very different but has a lot to teach about Support. 

If you like psychology, Barrett's How Emotions Are Made is a future classic.

If you like Unix, I recommend Kernighan's Unix: A History.
