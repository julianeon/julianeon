### Fiction

I'm a big fan of Philip K. Dick and his best books - Man In The High Castle and Ubik, especially.

A close second would be The Best of Greg Egan. Also liked Schild's Ladder.

Two books that I loved that I rarely see mentioned are Bodard's Obsidian & Blood series & Garfinkel's All Of An Instant.

Greatly enjoyed LOTR and Dune.

On the longer side: In Search of Lost Time, War and Peace, Moby Dick.

Also read Vol. 1 of The Arabian Nights (1 of 3). Working on the next volume.

### Nonfiction

For a history of tech, Fire In The Valley is outstanding.

Tim Wu's The Attention Merchants is terrific too, more of a global history of technology.

The Maverick & His Machine by Maney, about IBM and its founder Watson, makes a good companion piece.

I learned a lot from Global Capitalism by Freidan.

It goes well with The Penguin History of the World, for an overview. 

The Chosen by Karabel is incredible, a history of American university admissions.

The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Rhodes is great too.


If you like psychology, Barrett's How Emotions Are Made is a classic in the making.
